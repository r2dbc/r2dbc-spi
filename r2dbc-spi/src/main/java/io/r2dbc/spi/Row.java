import java.util.function.BiFunction;

/**
 * Represents a row returned from a database query.
 * Values from columns can be either retrieved by specifying a column name or the column index.
 * Columns are numbered from 0.  Column names do not necessarily reflect the column names how they are in the underlying tables but rather how columns are represented (e.g. aliased) in the result.
 *
 * <p> Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive.
 * When a get method is called with a column name and several columns have the same name, then the value of the first matching column will be returned.
 * The column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the SQL query that generated the result set.
 * Columns that are not explicitly named in the query should be referenced through column indexes.
 *
 * <p>For maximum portability, result columns within each {@link Row} should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be read only once.
 *
 * <p>{@link #get(Object)} without specifying a target type returns a suitable value representation.  The R2DBC specification contains a mapping table that shows default mappings between database
 * types and Java types.
 * Specifying a target type, the R2DBC driver attempts to convert the value to the target type.
 * <p>A row is invalidated after consumption in the {@link Result#map(BiFunction) mapping function}.
 * <p>The number, type and characteristics of columns are described through {@link RowMetadata}
