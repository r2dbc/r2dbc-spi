[[connections]]
= Connections

R2DBC uses the `Connection` interface to define a logical connection API to the underlying data source.
A structure of a connection depends on the actual requirements of a data source and how the driver implements these.

The data source can be an RDBMS, a stream-oriented data system some other source of data with a corresponding R2DBC driver.
A single application using R2DBC API may maintain multiple connections to either a single data source or across multiple data sources.
From a R2DBC driver perspective, a `Connection` object represents a single client session.
It has associated state information such as user ID and what transaction semantics are in effect.
A `Connection` object is not thread-safe in the sense that it can be shared across multiple Threads that concurrently execute statements or change its state.
A connection object can be shared across multiple Threads that execute operations serially using appropriate synchronization mechanisms.

To obtain a connection, the application may interact with either:

* the `ConnectionFactories` class working with one or more `ConnectionFactoryProvider` implementations

*OR*

* directly a `ConnectionFactory` implementation.

See <<overview.connection>> for more details.

[[connections.factory]]
== The `ConnectionFactory` Interface

R2DBC drivers must implement the `ConnectionFactory` interface as a mandatory part of the SPI.
Drivers can provide multiple `ConnectionFactory` implementations depending on the used protocol or aspects that require the use of a different `ConnectionFactory` implementation.

.`ConnectionFactory` Interface
====
[source,java]
----
public interface ConnectionFactory {

    Publisher<? extends Connection> create();

    ConnectionFactoryMetadata getMetadata();

}
----
====

The following rules apply:

* A `ConnectionFactory` represents a resource factory for deferred connection creation.
It may create connections by itself, wrap a `ConnectionFactory` or apply connection pooling on top of a `ConnectionFactory`.
* A `ConnectionFactory` provides metadata about the driver itself through `ConnectionFactoryMetadata`.
* A `ConnectionFactory` uses deferred initialization and should initiate connection resource allocation after requesting the item (`Subscription.request(1)`).
* Connection creation must emit exactly one `Connection` or an error signal.
* Connection creation must be cancellable (`Subscription.cancel()`). Canceling connection creation must release ("close") the connection and all associated resources.
* A `ConnectionFactory` should expect that it can be wrapped. Wrappers must implement the `Wrapped<ConnectionFactory>` interface and return the underlying `ConnectionFactory` when `Wrapped.unwrap()` gets called.

**ConnectionFactory Metadata**

ConnectionFactories are required to expose metadata to identify the driver (`ConnectionFactory`) and its capabilities.
Metadata must not require a connection to a data source.

.`ConnectionFactoryMetadata` Interface
====
[source,java]
----
public interface ConnectionFactoryMetadata {

    String getName();

}
----

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.

[[connections.factory.discovery]]
== `ConnectionFactory` Discovery Mechanism

As part of its usage, the `ConnectionFactories` class attempts to load any R2DBC driver classes referenced
by the `ConnectionFactoryProvider` interface listed in the Java Service Provider manifests available on the CLASSPATH.

Drivers must include the file `META-INF/services/io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactoryProvider`.
This file contains the name of the R2DBC driver's implementation (or implementations) of `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactoryProvider`.
To ensure that drivers can be loaded using this mechanism, `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactoryProvider` implementations are required to provide a no-argument constructor.

.`ConnectionFactoryProvider` Interface
====
[source,java]
----
public interface ConnectionFactoryProvider {

    ConnectionFactory create(ConnectionFactoryOptions connectionFactoryOptions);

    boolean supports(ConnectionFactoryOptions connectionFactoryOptions);

}
----
====

`ConnectionFactories` uses a `ConnectionFactoryOptions` object to lookup a matching driver using a two-step model:

1. Lookup of an adequate `ConnectionFactoryProvider`.
2. Obtain the `ConnectionFactory` from the `ConnectionFactoryProvider`.

`ConnectionFactoryProvider` implementations are required to return a `boolean` indicator whether they support a specific configuration represented by `ConnectionFactoryOptions`.
Drivers must expect any plurality of ``Option``s to be configured.
Drivers must report that they support a configuration only if the `ConnectionFactoryProvider` can provide a `ConnectionFactory` based on the given `ConnectionFactoryOptions`.
Drivers should gracefully fail if a `ConnectionFactory` creation through `ConnectionFactoryProvider.create(…)` is not possible.

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.

[[connections.factory.options]]
== The `ConnectionFactoryOptions` Class

The `ConnectionFactoryOptions` class represents a configuration to request a `ConnectionFactory` from a `ConnectionFactoryProvider`.
It represents the <<overview.connection, programmatic connection creation>> approach without using driver-specific classes.
`ConnectionFactoryOptions` instances are created using the builder pattern and properties are configured through `Option<T>` identifiers.
A `ConnectionFactoryOptions` is immutable once created.
`Option` objects are reused as part of the built-in constant pool.
Options are identified by a literal.

`ConnectionFactoryOptions` defines a set of well-known options:

.Well-known Options
|===
|Constant |Literal |Type |Description

|`DRIVER`
|`driver`
|`java.lang.String`
|Driver identifier.

|`PROTOCOL`
|`protocol`
|`java.lang.String`
|Protocol details such as the network protocol used to communicate with a server.

|`USER`
|`user`
|`java.lang.String`
|User account name.

|`PASSWORD`
|`password`
|`java.lang.CharSequence`
|User or database password.

|`HOST`
|`host`
|`java.lang.String`
|Database server name.

|`PORT`
|`port`
|`java.lang.Integer`
|Database server port number.


|`DATABASE`
|`database`
|`java.lang.String`
|Name of the particular database on a server.

|`CONNECT_TIMEOUT`
|`connectTimeout`
|`java.time.Duration`
|Connection timeout to obtain a connection.
|===

The following rules apply:

* The set of options is extensible.
* Drivers can declare which well-known options that they require and which they support.
* Drivers can declare which extended options they require and which they support.
* Drivers should not fail in creating a connection if more options are declared than the driver consumes as a `ConnectionFactory` should expect to be wrapped.

.Configuration of `ConnectionFactoryOptions`
====
[source,java]
----
ConnectionFactoryOptions options = ConnectionFactoryOptions.builder()
    .option(ConnectionFactoryOptions.HOST, "…")
    .option(Option.valueOf("tenant"), "…")
    .option(Option.sensitiveValueOf("encryptionKey"), "…")
    .build();
----

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.

== Obtaining `Connection` Objects

Once a `ConnectionFactory` is bootstrapped, connections are obtained from the `create()` method.

.Obtaining a `Connection`
====
[source,java]
----
// factory is a ConnectionFactory object
Publisher<? extends Connection> publisher = factory.create();
----
====

The connection is active once it was emitted by the `Publisher` and must be released ("closed") once it is no longer in use.

== Closing `Connection` Objects

Calling `Connection.close()` prepares a close handle to release the connection and its associated resources.
Connections must be closed to ensure proper resource management.

.Closing a `Connection`
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a ConnectionFactory object
Publisher<Void> close = connection.create();
----
====

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.
