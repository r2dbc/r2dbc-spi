= Overview

R2DBC provides an API for Java programs to access one or more sources of data.
In the majority of cases, the data source is a relational DBMS, and its data is accessed using SQL.
R2DBC drivers are not limited to RDBMS but can be implemented on top of other data sources, including stream-oriented systems
and object-oriented systems.
A primary motivation for R2DBC API is providing a standard API for reactive applications to integrate with a wide variety of data sources.
This chapter gives an overview of the API and the key concepts of the R2DBC API.

[[overview.connection]]
== Establishing a Connection

R2DBC uses the `Connection` interface to define a logical connection API to the underlying data source.
A structure of a connection depends on the actual requirements of a data source and how the driver implements these.

In a typical scenario, an application using R2DBC connects to a target data source using one of two mechanisms:

* `ConnectionFactories`: R2DBC SPI provides this fully implemented class. It provides `ConnectionFactory` discovery functionality for applications that want to obtain a connection without using vendor-specific API.
When an application first attempts to connect to a data source, `ConnectionFactories` automatically loads any R2DBC driver found within the CLASSPATH using Java's `ServiceLoader` mechanism.
See <<connections.factory.discovery, ConnectionFactory Discovery>> for details on how to implement the discovery mechanism for a particular driver.
* `ConnectionFactory`: A `ConnectionFactory` is implemented by a driver and provides access to <<connections,`Connection`>> creation. An application that wants to configure vendor-specific aspects of a driver can use the vendor-specific `ConnectionFactory` creation mechanism to configure a `ConnectionFactory`.

[[overview.connection.discovery]]
=== Using `ConnectionFactory` Discovery

As mentioned earlier, R2DBC supports the concept of discovery to find an appropriate driver for a connection request.
Providing a `ConnectionFactory` to an application is typically a configuration-infrastructure task.
Applications that wish to bootstrap an R2DBC client, typically handle this aspect directly in application code and so, discovery can become a task for application developers.

`ConnectionFactories` provides two standard mechanisms to bootstrap a `ConnectionFactory`:

* URL-based: R2DBC supports a uniform URL-based configuration scheme with a well-defined structure and well-known configuration properties. URLs are represented as Java `String` and can be passed to `ConnectionFactories` for `ConnectionFactory` lookup.
* Programmatic: In addition to a URL-based configuration, R2DBC provides a programmatic approach so applications can supply structured configuration options to obtain a `ConnectionFactory`.

R2DBC embraces in addition to the two methods mentioned above a mixed mechanism as typical configuration infrastructure mixes URL- and programmatic-based configuration of data sources for enhanced flexibility.
A typical use case is the separation of concerns in which data source coordinates are supplied using an URL while login credentials originate from a different configuration source.

[[overview.connection.url]]
=== R2DBC Connection URL

R2DBC defines a standard URL format that is an enhanced form of https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt[RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax] and its amendments supported by Java's `java.net.URI` type.

Syntax Components from https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt[RFC3986]:

[source,subs="none"]

      URI         = scheme ":" driver [ ":" protocol ] ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

      scheme      = "r2dbc" / "r2dbcs"

      driver      = ALPHA *( ALPHA )

      protocol    = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." / ":")

      hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty

      authority   = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ] [ "," host [ ":" port ] ]

      userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )

      host        = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name

      port        = *DIGIT

      query       = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )

      fragment    = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )

      pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

      pchar       = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"

      sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                 / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="

      unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

* scheme: Identify that the URL is a valid R2DBC URL. Valid schemes are `r2dbc` and `r2dbcs` (configure SSL usage).
* driver: Identifier for a driver. R2DBC has no authority over driver identifiers.
* protocol: Used as optional protocol information to configure a driver-specific protocol. Protocols can be organized hierarchically and are separated by a colon (":").
* authority: Contains endpoint and authorization. The authority may contain a single host or a collection of hostnames/hostname and port tuples by separating these with a comma (",").
* path (Optional): Used as an initial schema/database name.
* query (Optional): Used to pass additional configuration options in the form of `String` key-value pairs using the key name as option name.
* fragment: Unused ("Reserved for future use")

`ConnectionFactoryOptions.parse(String)` parses a R2DBC URL into `ConnectionFactoryOptions` using Standard- and optional Extended options.
A R2DBC Connection URL is parsed into the following options (using `ConnectionFactoryOptions` constants):

r2dbc:a-driver:pipes://hello:world@localhost:3306/my_database?locale=en_US

NOTE: R2DBC defines well-known standard options that are available as runtime constants through `ConnectionFactories`. Additional options identifiers are created through `Option.valueOf(â€¦)`.
