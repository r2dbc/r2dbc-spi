== What is R2DBC?

R2DBC stands for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity.
R2DBC started as experiment and proof of concept to enable integration of relational databases into systems using reactive programming models â€“ Reactive in the sense of an event-driven, non-blocking and functional programming model that does not make assumptions over concurrency or asynchronicity. Instead, it assumes scheduling and parallelization to happen as part of the runtime scheduling.

[[introduction.r2dbc-spi]]
== The R2DBC SPI

The R2DBC SPI provides reactive programmatic access to relational databases from the Java and other JVM-based programming languages.

R2DBC specifies a service-provider interface (SPI) intended to be implemented by driver vendors and used by client libraries.
Using the R2DBC SPI, applications written in a JVM programming language can execute SQL statements, and retrieve results using an underlying data source.
The R2DBC SPI can also be used to interact with multiple data sources in a distributed, heterogeneous environment.
R2DBC targets primarily, but is not limited to, relational databases.
It aims for a range of data sources whose query and statement interface is based on SQL (or a SQL-like dialect) and represent their data in a tabular form.

A key difference between R2DBC and imperative data access SPIs is the deferred nature of execution. R2DBC is therefore based on https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] to use the concept of `Publisher` and `Subscriber` to allow non-blocking backpressure-aware data access.

[[introduction.target-audience]]
== Target Audience

This specification is targeted primarily towards:

* Vendors of drivers that implement the R2DBC SPI.
* Vendors of client implementations that wish to implement a client on top of the R2DBC SPI.
* Vendors of runtime libraries that wish to embed R2DBC into their eco-system to provide R2DBC runtime services.

This specification is also intended to serve the following purposes:

* Introduction for end-users whose applications use the R2DBC SPI.
* Starting point for developers of other SPIs layered on top of the R2DBC SPI.

[[introduction.acknowledgements]]
== Acknowledgements

The R2DBC specification work is being conducted as an effort of individuals that recognized the demand for a reactive, standardized API for relational database access.
We want to thank all https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/graphs/contributors[contributing members] for their countless hours of work and discussion.

Thanks also go to Ollie without whom this initiative would not even exist.
