[[introduction.what-is-r2dbc]]
R2DBC stands for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity.
R2DBC started as an experiment and proof of concept to enable integration of SQL databases into systems that use reactive programming models â€“- Reactive in the sense of an event-driven, non-blocking, and functional programming model that does not make assumptions over concurrency or asynchronicity.
Instead, it assumes that scheduling and parallelization happen as part of runtime scheduling.

[[introduction.r2dbc-spi]]
== The R2DBC SPI

The R2DBC SPI provides reactive programmatic access to relational databases from Java and other JVM-based programming languages.

R2DBC specifies a service-provider interface (SPI) that is intended to be implemented by driver vendors and used by client libraries.
By using the R2DBC SPI, applications written in a JVM programming language can run SQL statements and retrieve results by using an underlying data source.
You can also use the R2DBC SPI to interact with multiple data sources in a distributed, heterogeneous environment.
R2DBC targets primarily, but is not limited to, relational databases.
It aims for a range of data sources whose query and statement interface is based on SQL (or an SQL-like dialect) and that represent their data in a tabular form.

A key difference between R2DBC and imperative data access SPIs is the deferred nature of execution.
R2DBC is, therefore, based on https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] and uses the concepts of `Publisher` and `Subscriber` to allow non-blocking back-pressure-aware data access.

[[introduction.requirements-conventions]]
== Requirements and Conventions

R2DBC requires Java 8 as baseline and https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] in terms of a reactive inter-op API.

A note about modules: R2DBC allow for deployment to JDK 9's module path ("Jigsaw").
For use in Jigsaw-enabled applications, the R2DBC SPI comes with "Automatic-Module-Name" manifest entries which define stable language-level module names ("r2dbc.spi") instead using the artifact name.
Of course, R2DBC jars keep working fine on the classpath on both JDK 8 and 9+.

R2DBC's SPI uses non-null semantics by default.
Nullable API members are annotated with `@io.r2dbc.spi.Nullable`.
This annotation and `@NonNullApi` are meta-annotated with https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[JSR 305] annotations (a dormant but wide-spread JSR).
JSR-305 meta-annotations let tooling vendors like IDEA or Kotlin provide null-safety support in a generic way, without having to hard-code support for R2DBC annotations.
It is not necessary nor recommended to add a JSR-305 dependency to the project classpath to take advantage of a null-safe API.

R2DBC generally uses zero-based indexes for parameter binding and columns.

[[introduction.target-audience]]
== Target Audience

This specification is targeted primarily towards:

* Vendors of drivers that implement the R2DBC SPI.
* Vendors of client implementations who wish to implement a client on top of the R2DBC SPI.
* Vendors of runtime libraries who wish to embed R2DBC into their eco-system to provide R2DBC runtime services.

This specification is also intended to offer:

* An introduction for end-users whose applications use the R2DBC SPI.
* A starting point for developers of other SPIs layered on top of the R2DBC SPI.

Code examples in this specification assume external subscription to `Publisher` objects for brevity.

[[introduction.acknowledgements]]
== Acknowledgements

The R2DBC specification work is being conducted as an effort of individuals that recognized the demand for a reactive, standardized API for relational database access.
We want to thank all https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/graphs/contributors[contributing members] for their countless hours of work and discussion.

Thanks also go to Ollie Drotbohm, without whom this initiative would not even exist.
