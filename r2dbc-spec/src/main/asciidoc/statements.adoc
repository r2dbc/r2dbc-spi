This section describes the `Statement` interface. It also describes related topics, including parameterized statement and auto-generated keys.

[[statements.interface]]
== The Statement Interface

The `Statement` interface defines methods for executing SQL statements. SQL statements may contain parameter bind markers for input parameters.

[[statements.creating]]
=== Creating Statements

`Statement` objects are created by `Connection` objects, as is done in the following example:

.Creating a non-parameterized `Statement`
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books");
----
====

Each `Connection` object can create multiple `Statement` objects that may be used concurrently by the program and executed at any time.
Resources that are associated with a statement are released as soon as the connection is closed.

[[statements.executing]]
=== Executing Statement Objects

`Statement` objects are executed by calling the `execute()` method. Depending on the SQL, the resulting `Publisher` may return one to many `Result` objects. A `Statement` is always associated with its `Connection`, therefore, the connection state affects `Statement` execution at execution time.

. Executing a `Statement`
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();
----
====

[[statements.parameterized]]
== Parameterized Statements

SQL used to create a statement can be parameterized using vendor-specific bind markers.
Portability of SQL statements across R2DBC implementation is a non-goal.

Parameterized `Statement` objects are created by `Connection` objects in the same manner as non-parameterized `Statements`. See the the following example:

.Creating three parameterized `Statement` objects using vendor-specific parameter bind markers
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement1 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = :author");

Statement statement2 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = @P0");

Statement statement3 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1");
----
====

Parameter bind markers are identified by the `Statement` object.
Parameterized statements may be cached by R2DBC implementations for resuse (e.g. for prepared statement execution).

[[statements.bind]]
=== Binding Parameters

The `Statement` interface defines `bind(…)` and `bindNull(…)` methods to provide parameter values for bind marker substitution.
The parameter type is defined by the actual value that is bound to a parameter.
Each bind method accepts two arguments. The first is either ordinal parameter position starting at `0` (zero) or the parameter placeholder representation.
The second and any remaining parameters specify the value to be assigned to the parameter.

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object by placeholder
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind("$1", "John Doe");
statement.bind("$2", "Happy Books LLC");
----
====

Alternatively, parameters can be bound by index:

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object by index
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind(0, "John Doe");
statement.bind(1, "Happy Books LLC");
----
====

A value must be provided for each bind marker in the `Statement` object before it can be executed.
The `execute` method validates a parameterized `Statement` and throws an `IllegalStateException` if a bind marker is left without a binding.

[[statements.batching]]
=== Batching

Parameterized `Statement` objects accept multiple parameter binding sets submit a batch of commands to the database for execution.
Batch execution is initiated by invoking the `add()` method on the `Statement` object after providing all parameters.
After calling `add()`, the next set of parameter bindings is provided by calling bind methods accordingly.

.Executing a `Statement` batch
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO books (author, publisher) VALUES ($1, $2)");
statement.bind(0, "John Doe").bind(1, "Happy Books LLC").add();
statement.bind(0, "Jane Doe").bind(1, "Scary Books Inc");
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();
----
====

Batch execution emits one to many `Result` objects depending on how the implementation executes the batch.

[[statements.null]]
=== Setting `NULL` Parameters

The method `bindNull` can be used to set any parameter to `NULL`.
It takes two parameters, either the ordinal position of the bind marker or the name, and the value type of the parameter.

.Setting a `NULL` value.
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
statement.bindNull(0, String.class);
----
====

[[statements.generated-values]]
== Retrieving Auto Generated Values

Many database systems provide a mechanism that automatically generates a value when inserting a row.
The value that is generated may or may not be unique or represent a key value depending on the executed SQL, and table definition.
The method `returnGeneratedValues`, which can be called to retrieve the generated value, indicates to the `Statement` object to retrieve generated values. The method accepts a var-arg parameter to specify the column name(s) for which to return generated keys.
The emitted `Result` exposes a column for each automatically generated value taking the column name hint into account.

.Retrieving auto-generated values
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO books (author, publisher) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Happy Books LLC')").returnGeneratedValues("id");
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();

// later
result.map((row, metadata) -> row.get("id"));
----
====

When not specifying column name(s), the R2DBC driver implementation will determine the columns or value to return.

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.

[[statements.performance]]
== Performance Hints

The `Statement` interface provides a method that can be used to provide hints to a R2DBC driver.
Calling `fetchSize` applies a fetch size hint to each query produced by the statement.
Hints provided to the driver through this interface may be ignored by the driver if they are not appropriate or supported.
Typically, fetch size can be derived from back-pressure hints.
To optimize for performance it can be useful to provide hints to the driver on a per-statement basis.
