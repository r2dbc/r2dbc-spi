= Statements

This section describes the `Statement` interface. It also describes related topics, including parameterized statement and auto-generated keys.

[[statements.interface]]
== The Statement Interface

The `Statement` interface defines methods for executing SQL statements. SQL statements may contain parameter bind markers for input parameters.

[[statements.creating]]
=== Creating Statements

`Statement` objects are created by `Connection` objects, as is done in the following example:

.Creating a non-parameterized `Statement`
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books");
----
====

Each `Connection` object can create multiple `Statement` objects that may be used concurrently by the program and executed at any time.
Resources that are associated with a statement are released as soon as the connection is closed.

[[statements.executing]]
=== Executing Statement Objects

`Statement` objects are executed by calling the `execute()` method. Depending on the SQL, the resulting `Publisher` may return one to many `Result` objects. A `Statement` is always associated with its `Connection`, therefore, the connection state affects `Statement` execution at execution time.

. Executing a `Statement`
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();
----
====

[[statements.parameterized]]
== Parameterized Statements

SQL used to create a statement can be parameterized using vendor-specific bind markers.
Portability of SQL statements across R2DBC implementation is a non-goal.

Parameterized `Statement` objects are created by `Connection` objects in the same manner as non-parameterized `Statements`. See the the following example:

.Creating three parameterized `Statement` objects using vendor-specific parameter bind markers
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement1 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = :author");

Statement statement2 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = @P0");

Statement statement3 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1");
----
====

Parameter bind markers are identified by the `Statement` object.
Parameterized statements may be cached by R2DBC implementations for resuse (e.g. for prepared statement execution).

[[statements.bind]]
=== Binding Parameters

The `Statement` interface defines `bind(…)` and `bindNull(…)` methods to provide parameter values for bind marker substitution.
The parameter type is defined by the actual value that is bound to a parameter.
Each bind method accepts two arguments. The first is either ordinal parameter position starting at `0` (zero) or the parameter placeholder representation.
The second and any remaining parameters specify the value to be assigned to the parameter.

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object by placeholder
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind("$1", "John Doe");
statement.bind("$2", "Happy Books LLC");
----
====

Alternatively, parameters can be bound by index:

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object by index
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind(0, "John Doe");
statement.bind(1, "Happy Books LLC");
----
====

A value must be provided for each bind marker in the `Statement` object before it can be executed.
The method used to execute a parameterized `Statement` an `IllegalStateException` if a value is not supplied for a bind marker.

[[statements.batching]]
=== Batching

Parameterized `Statement` objects accept multiple parameter binding sets submit a batch of commands to the database for execution.
Batch execution is initiated by invoking the `add()` method on the `Statement` object after providing all parameters.
After calling `add()`, the next set of parameter bindings is provided by calling bing methods accordingly.

.Executing a `Statement` batch
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO books (author, publisher) VALUES ($1, $2)");
statement.bind(0, "John Doe").bind(1, "Happy Books LLC").add();
statement.bind(0, "Jane Doe").bind(1, "Scary Books Inc");
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();
----
====

Batch execution emits one to many `Result` objects depending on how the implementation executes the batch.

[[statements.null]]
=== Setting `NULL` Parameters

The method `bindNull` can be used to set any parameter to `NULL`.
It takes two parameters, either the ordinal position of the bind marker or the name, and the value type of the parameter.

.Setting a `NULL` value.
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
statement.bindNull(0, String.class);
----
====

[[statements.generated-values]]
== Retrieving Auto Generated Values

Many database systems provide a mechanism that automatically generates a value when inserting a row.
The value that is generated may or may not be unique or represent a key value depending on the executed SQL, and table definition.
The method `returnGeneratedValues`, which can be called to retrieve the generated value, indicates to the `Statement` object to retrieve generated values. The method accepts a var-arg parameter to specify the column name(s) for which to return generated keys.
The emitted `Result` exposes a column for each automatically generated value taking the column name hint into account.

.Retrieving auto-generated values
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO books (author, publisher) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Happy Books LLC')").returnGeneratedValues("id");
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();

// later
result.map((row, metadata) -> row.get("id"));
----
====

When not specifying column name(s), the R2DBC driver implementation will determine the columns or value to return.

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.
