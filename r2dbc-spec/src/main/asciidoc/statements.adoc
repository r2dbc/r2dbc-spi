This section describes the `Statement` interface. It also describes related topics, including parameterized statement and auto-generated keys.

[[statements.interface]]
== The Statement Interface

The `Statement` interface defines methods for running SQL statements.
SQL statements may contain parameter bind markers for input parameters.

[[statements.creating]]
=== Creating Statements

`Statement` objects are created by `Connection` objects, as the following example shows:

.Creating a non-parameterized `Statement`
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books");
----
====

Each `Connection` object can create multiple `Statement` objects that the program can concurrently run at any time.
Resources that are associated with a statement are released as soon as the connection is closed.

[[statements.executing]]
=== Running Statement Objects

`Statement` objects are run by calling the `execute()` method.
Depending on the SQL, the resulting `Publisher` may return one or many `Result` objects.
A `Statement` is always associated with its `Connection`.
Therefore, the connection state affects `Statement` execution at execution time.
The following example shows how to run a statement:

.Running a `Statement`
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();
----
====

[[statements.parameterized]]
== Parameterized Statements

The SQL that is used to create a statement can be parameterized by using vendor-specific bind markers.
The portability of SQL statements across R2DBC implementations is not a goal.

Parameterized `Statement` objects are created by `Connection` objects in the same manner as non-parameterized `Statements`.
See the the following example:

.Creating three parameterized `Statement` objects by using vendor-specific parameter bind markers
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement1 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = :author");

Statement statement2 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = @P0");

Statement statement3 = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1");
----
====

Parameter bind markers are identified by the `Statement` object.
Parameterized statements may be cached by R2DBC implementations for reuse (for example, for prepared statement execution).

[[statements.bind]]
=== Binding Parameters

The `Statement` interface defines `bind(…)` and `bindNull(…)` methods to provide parameter values for bind marker substitution.
A parameter value consists of the actual value that is bound to a parameter and its type. Using scalar values according to <<datatypes.mapping>> lets the R2DBC infer the actual database type. Using a `Parameter` object allows for more control over the database type definition.
Each bind method accepts two arguments.
The first is either an ordinal position parameter starting at `0` (zero) or the parameter placeholder representation.
The method of parameter binding (positional or by identifier) is vendor-specific, and a driver should document its preferred binding mechanism.
The second and any remaining parameters specify the value to be assigned to the parameter.
The following example shows how to bind parameters to a statement object by using placeholders:

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object by using placeholders
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind("$1", "John Doe");
statement.bind("$2", "Happy Books LLC");
----
====

Alternatively, parameters can be bound by index, as the following example shows:

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object by index
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind(0, "John Doe");
statement.bind(1, "Happy Books LLC");
----
====

Binding parameters using a `Parameter` with a `Type` allows for more control over the actual database type.
`io.r2dbc.spi.R2dbcType` defines commonly used types.

.Binding parameters to a `Statement` object using a `Parameter` object
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = $1 and publisher = $2");
statement.bind(0, Parameters.in(R2dbcType.NVARCHAR, "John Doe"));
statement.bind(1, Parameters.in(R2dbcType.VARCHAR, "Happy Books LLC"));
----
====

A value must be provided for each bind marker in the `Statement` object before the statement can be run.
The `execute` method validates a parameterized `Statement` and throws an `IllegalStateException` if a bind marker is left without a binding.

[[statements.batching]]
=== Batching

Parameterized `Statement` objects accept multiple parameter binding sets to submit a batch of commands to the database for running.
A batch run is initiated by invoking the `add()` method on the `Statement` object after providing all parameters.
After calling `add()`, the next set of parameter bindings is provided by calling bind methods accordingly.
The following example shows how to run a batch `Statement`:

.Running a `Statement` batch
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO books (author, publisher) VALUES ($1, $2)");
statement.bind(0, "John Doe").bind(1, "Happy Books LLC").add();
statement.bind(0, "Jane Doe").bind(1, "Scary Books Inc");
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();
----
====

A batch run emits one or many `Result` objects, depending on how the implementation executes the batch.

[[statements.null]]
=== Setting `NULL` Parameters

You can use the `bindNull` method to set any parameter to `NULL`.
It takes two parameters:

* Either the ordinal position of the bind marker or the name.
* The value type of the parameter.

The following example shows how to set `NULL` value:

.Setting a `NULL` value using type inference.
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
statement.bindNull(0, String.class);
----
====

Typed `Parameter` objects representing a null value can be bound either by calling `bindNull(…)` or `bind(…)`:

.Setting a typed `NULL` value.
====
[source,java]
----
// statement is a Statement object
statement.bind(0, Parameters.in(R2dbcType.VARCHAR));
----
====

NOTE: Not all databases allow for a non-typed `NULL` to be sent to the underlying database.

[[statements.generated-values]]
== Retrieving Auto Generated Values

Many database systems provide a mechanism that automatically generates a value when a row is inserted.
The value that is generated may or may not be unique or represent a key value, depending on the SQL and the table definition.
You can call the `returnGeneratedValues` method to retrieve the generated value.
It tells the `Statement` object to retrieve generated values.
The method accepts a variable-argument parameter to specify the column names for which to return generated keys.
The emitted `Result` exposes a column for each automatically generated value (taking the column name hint into account).
The following example shows how to retrieve auto-generated values:

.Retrieving auto-generated values
====
[source,java]
----
// connection is a Connection object
Statement statement = connection.createStatement("INSERT INTO books (author, publisher) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Happy Books LLC')").returnGeneratedValues("id");
Publisher<? extends Result> publisher = statement.execute();

// later
result.map((row, metadata) -> row.get("id"));
----
====

When column names are not specified, the R2DBC driver implementation determines the columns or value to return.

See the R2DBC SPI Specification for more details.

[[statements.performance]]
== Performance Hints

The `Statement` interface provides a method that you can use to provide hints to a R2DBC driver.
Calling `fetchSize` applies a fetch-size hint to each query produced by the statement.
Hints provided to the driver through this interface may be ignored by the driver if they are not appropriate or supported.

Back-pressure hints can be used by drivers to derive an appropriate fetch size.
To optimize for performance, it can be useful to provide hints to the driver on a per-statement basis to avoid unwanted interference of back-pressure hint propagation.

Note that back-pressure should be considered a utility for flow control and not to limit the result size.
Result size limitations should be part of the query statement.
