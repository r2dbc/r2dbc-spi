= Goals

This section outlines the goals for R2DBC and the design philosophy for its SPI.

[[goals.enabling]]
== Enable Reactive Relational Database Connectivity

The R2DBC specification aims for establishing an interface with a minimal API surface to integrate with relational databases using a reactive programming model.
The most significant goals are honoring and embracing the properties of reactive programming:

* Non-blocking I/O
* Deferred execution
* Treat application control as series of events (data, errors, completion)
* No longer assume control of resources but leave resource scheduling to the runtime/platform („React to resource availability“)
* Efficient usage of resources
* Leave flow control to be handled by the runtime
* Stream-oriented data consumption
* Functional programming within operators
* Remove assumptions over concurrency from the programming model and leave this aspect up the runtime
* Use back-pressure to allow flow control, to defer the actual execution and to not overwhelm consumers

[[goals.reactive-jvm]]
== Fit into Reactive JVM platforms

R2DBC aims for seamless integration of reactive JVM platforms targeting Java as its primary platform.
R2DBC should also be usable from other platforms such as Kotlin or Scala without scarifying its SPI for the sake of idiomatic use in a different platform.

[[goals.standardization]]
== Offer vendor-neutral access to standard features

R2DBC SPI strives to provide access to features that are commonly found across different vendor implementations.
The goal here is providing a balance between features that are implemented in a driver and these that are better implemented in a client library.

[[goals.vendor-specifics]]
== Embrace vendor-specific features

Each database comes with its very own feature set and how these are implemented.
R2DBC's goal here is to define a minimal standard over commonly used functionality and allow for vendor-specific deviation.
Drivers can implement additional functionality or make these transparent through R2DBC SPI.

[[goals.sql]]
== Keep the focus on SQL

The focus of R2DBC is on accessing relational data from the Java programming language using databases that provide a SQL interface to interact with.

The goal here is not to limit implementations to relational-only databases.
Instead, providing guidance for uniform reactive data access using tabular data consumption patterns.

[[goals.kiss]]
== Keep it minimal and simple

R2DBC does not aim for being a general purpose data access API.

R2DBC specializes in reactive data access and common usage patterns that result from relational data interaction.
R2DBC does not aim for abstracting common functionality that needs to be re-implemented by driver vendors in a similar manner. It aims for leaving this functionality to client libraries of which there are typically fewer implementations than drivers.

[[goals.foundation]]
== Provide a foundation for tools and higher-level APIs

R2DBC SPI aims for being primarily consumed though client library implementations.

It does not aim for being an end-user or application developer programming interface.

Having a uniform reactive relational data access SPI makes R2DBC a valuable target platform for tool vendors and application developers who want to create portable tools and applications.

[[goals.requirements]]
== Specify requirements unambiguously

The requirements for R2DBC compliance should be unambiguous and easy to identify.
The R2DBC specification and the API documentation (Javadoc) clarify which features are required and which are optional.
